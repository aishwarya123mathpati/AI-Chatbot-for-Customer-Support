# AI Chatbot for Customer Support

## Project Overview
The **AI Chatbot for Customer Support** is a Python-based application designed to automate responses to common customer queries, enhancing efficiency and user satisfaction. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and pattern-matching algorithms to handle customer inquiries and provide quick, accurate responses.

## Features
- Automated responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- Pattern matching to identify user intent.
- Easily customizable database for FAQs and general responses.
- Scalable design for integration into websites or messaging platforms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for developing the chatbot.
- **Regex**: For pattern matching and intent recognition.
- **NLP Libraries**: For advanced query understanding (optional, e.g., spaCy or NLTK).
- **Flask**: (Optional) To create a web interface for the chatbot.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Basic understanding of Python programming and regular expressions.
- Libraries: `re`, `Flask` (optional for web interface).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-customer-support.git
   cd ai-chatbot-customer-support
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Chatbot**:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

2. **Customize FAQs**:
   Modify the `faqs` list in `chatbot.py` to include additional questions and responses:
   ```python
   faqs = [
       {"pattern": r"business hours", "response": "Our business hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM EST."},
       {"pattern": r"reset.*(password|pwd)", "response": "You can reset your password by clicking on the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page."}
   ]
   ```

3. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   Test the chatbot by typing queries into the console. The chatbot will provide responses based on the FAQ database.

## Example Queries
- "What are your business hours?"
- "How can I reset my password?"
- "What payment methods do you accept?"

```

## Customization
- **Expand the FAQ database**: Add more question patterns and responses.
- **Improve NLP capabilities**: Integrate libraries like spaCy or OpenAI's GPT models for more complex language understanding.
- **Deploy as a web service**: Use Flask or Django to create a web-based interface.
